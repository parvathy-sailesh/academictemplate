I am a PhD student in Public Policy at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. Currently under the mentorship of Prof. Yuhao Ba, I work on finding causal evidence that can inform climate policy. 

## Professional

Look at all the work that I do, results that I have! 


## Personal
Sometimes, I have free time and when I do I like to do things!
